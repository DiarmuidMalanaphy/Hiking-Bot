# Hiking-Bot

Discord bot, specifically for hiking club, but could be generalised.

Checks a CSV file of username and real name files, checks if the users are members on the server, if not makes the users members.

Contains helper scripts to run the program, contains a data cleaner to convert the file from LUSU format to a more data sensitive format (essentially gets rid of the excess information).

Could be used for other societies.
